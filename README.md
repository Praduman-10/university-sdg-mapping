# 🌍 Sustainable Development Goals in Higher Education Curriculum (HASS)

## 🎓 Overview

This project explores the alignment between academic modules and the United Nations **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** within the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) disciplines. Using data visualization techniques, we mapped the prevalence and distribution of SDG keywords across departments, stages of study, and modules.

- 📅 **Date**: June 2025  
- 🧰 **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, NetworkX, Squarify  
- 📊 **Visualizations**: Sunburst, Treemaps, Heatmaps, Chord Diagrams, Dot Matrix, Donut Charts

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Final_Data.xlsx`: The dataset containing module metadata and matched SDG keywords.
- `Green consultant graphical presentation.pdf`: A visual report compiling all generated graphs.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Python notebooks for generating each type of visualization.
- `images/`: High-resolution PNGs of each plot.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for modular reuse of plotting functions.
